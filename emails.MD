# Small Business Marketing Email Templates Library
## Implementation Plan & Template Documentation

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for integrating a library of **12 standard small business marketing email templates** into the email builder application. These templates are based on industry best practices, optimized for conversion, and designed to work seamlessly with the existing block-based email builder architecture.

**Implementation Strategy:** The templates will be created as simple JSON files in the `/templates` directory, using the exact same format and loading mechanism as the existing templates (Vercel, Stripe, Notion, Plaid). No new APIs, endpoints, or UI components are required.

### Template Categories

The library consists of 3 main categories:

1. **Welcome & Onboarding Emails** (4 templates)
   - New Subscriber Welcome
   - First Purchase Thank You
   - SaaS Trial Welcome/Activation
   - Product Announcement

2. **Promotional & Sales Emails** (4 templates)
   - Limited-Time Offer/Flash Sale
   - Abandoned Cart Recovery
   - Product Recommendation
   - Re-engagement/Win-Back

3. **Transactional & Relationship Emails** (4 templates)
   - Order Confirmation/Receipt
   - Shipping Notification
   - Customer Feedback/Review Request
   - Event Invitation

---

## Implementation Plan (Simplified)

### Phase 1: Understanding Existing System

**Current Template System:**
- Templates stored as JSON files in `/templates` directory
- Format: `{ metadata: {...}, blocks: [...] }`
- Loaded via `listTemplates()` and `loadTemplate(id)` in `/lib/email-templates.ts`
- Displayed in template grid on homepage
- Tags/categories used for filtering (via `TemplatesSidebar` component)

**Existing Template Structure:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "id": "template-slug",
    "name": "Template Display Name",
    "description": "Brief description",
    "category": "welcome",
    "tags": ["launch", "promotion"],
    "createdAt": "2025-10-07T22:19:57.299Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-10-07T22:19:57.299Z"
  },
  "blocks": [
    {
      "id": "block-0",
      "type": "heading",
      "content": "Your heading text with {variables}",
      "settings": {}
    },
    {
      "id": "block-1",
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Body text...",
      "settings": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

**Available Tags (from TemplatesSidebar):**
- launch
- promotion
- deal
- event
- announcement
- update
- feedback

### Phase 2: Create 12 Template JSON Files (Week 1-2)

**File Naming Convention:**
```
/templates/
  welcome-new-subscriber.json
  first-purchase-thank-you.json
  saas-trial-welcome.json
  product-announcement.json
  flash-sale-promotion.json
  abandoned-cart-recovery.json
  product-recommendations.json
  win-back-campaign.json
  order-confirmation.json
  shipping-notification.json
  feedback-request.json
  event-invitation.json
```

**Template Creation Process:**

For each template:
1. Create JSON file with proper structure
2. Define metadata (name, description, category, tags)
3. Build blocks array using existing block types:
   - `heading`
   - `text`
   - `button`
   - `image`
   - `divider`
4. Use placeholder variables in curly braces: `{companyName}`, `{customerName}`, etc.
5. Test by loading in the app

**Example Template Structure:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "id": "welcome-new-subscriber",
    "name": "New Subscriber Welcome",
    "description": "Welcome new email subscribers and introduce your brand with this warm, relationship-building template.",
    "category": "welcome",
    "tags": ["launch", "announcement"],
    "createdAt": "2025-01-15T00:00:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-01-15T00:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "blocks": [
    {
      "id": "block-0",
      "type": "heading",
      "content": "Welcome to {companyName}!",
      "settings": {}
    },
    {
      "id": "block-1",
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Hi {customerName},\n\nWe're thrilled to have you join our community! Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",
      "settings": {}
    },
    {
      "id": "block-2",
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Here's what you can expect from us:\n\n• Weekly tips and insights\n• Exclusive subscriber-only deals\n• Early access to new products\n• Helpful resources and guides",
      "settings": {}
    },
    {
      "id": "block-3",
      "type": "divider",
      "settings": {}
    },
    {
      "id": "block-4",
      "type": "button",
      "content": "Explore Our Products",
      "settings": {
        "url": "https://example.com"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "block-5",
      "type": "divider",
      "settings": {}
    },
    {
      "id": "block-6",
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Have questions? Just reply to this email—we'd love to hear from you!\n\nWith gratitude,\nThe {companyName} Team",
      "settings": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

### Phase 3: Update Tag Categories (Optional Enhancement)

**Consider Adding New Tags:**
If needed, update `AVAILABLE_TAGS` in `/components/templates-sidebar.tsx` to include:
- `welcome` - For onboarding emails
- `transactional` - For order/shipping emails
- `promotional` - For sales emails

**Current tags work well:**
- `launch` - Product announcements
- `promotion` - Sales & offers
- `deal` - Flash sales, discounts
- `event` - Event invitations
- `announcement` - General updates
- `update` - Product/feature updates
- `feedback` - Review requests

### Phase 4: Template Details Documentation

**For Each Template, Document:**

1. **Use Case** - When to send this email
2. **Subject Line Examples** - 3-5 proven subject lines
3. **Best Practices** - Tips for customization
4. **Performance Benchmarks** - Industry averages
5. **Variables to Replace** - List of placeholder variables

**Documentation Location:**
Create a `/templates/README.md` file with details for all 12 templates.

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] All JSON files are valid (no syntax errors)
- [ ] Templates load correctly in the app
- [ ] Blocks render properly in editor
- [ ] Variables are clearly marked with `{}`
- [ ] Tags filter correctly in sidebar
- [ ] Mobile responsive rendering
- [ ] Export to HTML/JSX works

**No Additional Code Required:**
The existing template system will automatically:
- Load the new JSON files
- Display them in the template grid
- Allow filtering by tags
- Enable editing in the visual editor
- Support export functionality
